                  <note>A reply, at least in part, to: Winslow, Edward. Hypocrisie unmasked (Wing W3037). Winslow, in his New-Englands salamander, discovered by an irreligious and scornefull pamphlet, called New-Englands Jonas cast up at London, &amp;c. Owned by Major John Childe, but not probable to be written by him (Wing W3038), obviously doubts Child's authorship of this item.</note>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Relation of the effects this Petition produced.</head>
            <p>THough this Petition of Dr. <hi>Child</hi> was in a peaceable way pre≈øented, only by two of the Sub≈øcribers; yet it produced the≈øe effects, and thus it wrought‚Äî</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, the Elders (not all, ≈øome few being ≈øilent) in their Congregations publikely u≈øing ≈øeverall Expre≈ø≈øions, but to one and the ≈øelf-≈øame end; as, That it was a ≈øeditions Petition full of malignancie, ≈øubvertive both to Church and Commonwealth in their foundations; Some calling the≈øe that ≈øo Petitioned, or comparing them to Sons of <hi>Belial, Juda≈ø≈øes,</hi> Sons of <hi>Corah</hi> with ≈øundry appellations of that nature, with ≈øome ≈øuch appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which ≈øeemed not to ari≈øe from a Go≈øpel ≈øpirit; u≈øually ekeing out their Sermons in large and defamatory declamations both again≈øt their Per≈øons and Petition, yea ≈øometimes a whole Sermon, and that not very ≈øhort neither being ≈øpent in enlarged ≈øentences to denote the de≈øtructivene≈ø≈øe thereof to Church and Commonwealth; yea publikely exhorting Authority to lay hold upon tho≈øe Petitioners, which the ≈øame night they did.</p>
            <p>Nor were the Magi≈øtrates in the mean ≈øea≈øon altogether ≈øilent, but ≈øpake in the ≈øame key; yea, One publikely in open Court gave charge to the Jury to take notice of ≈øuch of a Petition, and of ≈øuch as were that way affected, for they were both Pre≈øentable and puni≈øhable by their Law; for he ≈øaid it was a wicked Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, full of malignancie, ≈øubverting the very foundations both of Church and Commonwealth, or words to that effect; And how far it reached, he knew not, pointing (as was apprehended) at a Capital Law there made, here reprinted.</p>
            <p>Now at the next ≈øitting of the General Court, ≈øix of the ≈øeven that Petitioned, were ≈øent for by the Mar≈øhall to come to the Court, where they were charged <hi>ore temus,</hi> with great offences contained in their Petition and Remon≈øtrance, again≈øt the Court and Government, and that ≈øuch of them as were bound out of the Juri≈ødiction, ≈øhould enter into Bond with ≈øecurity, to ≈øtand and abide the Judgement of the Court, and the re≈øt were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and charged to attend the Court to the ≈øame end. The
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114099:9"/> Petitioners de≈øired to have their Charge in writing, which was then denied; and ≈øome added, That was but a trick of them that they might carry it and ≈øhew it in <hi>England:</hi> They replied, If the offences were contained in the Petition, they then mu≈øt needs be ≈øuch as concerned Government; and that the Parliament, now ≈øitting in <hi>England,</hi> were competent Judges, and could be≈øt di≈øcern ≈øuch errors; and therefore they did appeal to that High Court, and did tender ≈øufficient Securitie therefore. For which two of them were pre≈øently committed, and forced thereby to give Bond to ≈øtand to the Order of that Court therein. And the Cau≈øe afterwards came to Hearing, notwith≈øtanding they did appeal to the high Court of Parliament, and would have given Security; they were Fined, as appears by this their Cen≈øure. And ≈øince, two of them, Dr. <hi>Child</hi> and another, had their Trunks and Studies broke up, and their Papers taken away, and impri≈øoned clo≈øe pri≈øoners, and are in danger of their lives by rea≈øon of that Capitall Law here recited.</p>

            <p>WHen the fir≈øt ≈øhip that came this Year 1646. from <hi>New-England,</hi> was almo≈øt ready to come from thence; Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> in his Thur≈øday-Lecture at <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi> preached out of that Scripture, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Take us the little Foxes, &amp;c.</hi> In his U≈øes took occa≈øion to ≈øay, <hi>That if any ≈øhall carry any Writings, Complaints again≈øt the People of GOD in that Country, it would be as</hi> Jonas <hi>in the ≈øhip,</hi> with many words to per≈øwade from ≈øuch Complaints in <hi>England,</hi> ≈øaying that they ≈øhould ≈øeek for remedy of tho≈øe things that were ami≈ø≈øe, in that place, &amp; <hi>tell it not in Gath, nor publi≈øh it in Askelon.</hi> He al≈øo advi≈øed the Ship-Ma≈øter, that if ≈øtorms did ari≈øe, to ≈øearch if they had not in any che≈øt or Trunk any ≈øuch <hi>Jonas</hi> aboard, which if you find (≈øaid he) I do not advi≈øe you to throw the Per≈øons over-board, but the Writings; or words to that effect.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, having great<note n="*" place="margin">In the winter-≈øea≈øon all pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages from N. England are tempe≈øtuous.</note> ≈øtorms (as could not be otherwi≈øe expected) ≈øome of the Pa≈ø≈øengers remembring Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Sermon, it ≈øeems were much affected with what he had ≈øaid; and a woman among≈øt them came up from between the Decks about midnight, or after, in a di≈øtracted pa≈ø≈øionate manner, to Mr. <hi>William Va≈ø≈øall</hi> who lay in the great Cabin, but for the pre≈øent was in the Sterage-door-way looking abroad: ≈øhe earne≈øtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired him, if there were any <hi>Jonas</hi> in the ≈øhip, that as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> had directed, it might be thrown over-board, with many broken expre≈ø≈øions to that purpo≈øe. He asked her why ≈øhe came to him? and ≈øhe ≈øaid, becau≈øe it was thought that he had ≈øome Writings again≈øt the people of God: but he an≈øwered her, He had nothing but a Petition to the Parliament that they might enjoy the liberty of Engli≈øh ≈øubjects, and that could be no <hi>Jonas;</hi> and that if the be≈øt of <hi>New-Englands</hi> friends could ≈øhew him any evil in that, he would not prefer it. After this ≈øhe went into the great Cabin to Mr. <hi>Tho. Fowle</hi> in like di≈øtracted manner; who told her he had nothing but the Copy of the Petition which him≈øelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had pre≈øented to the Court at <hi>Bo≈øton;</hi> and ≈øhewed, and read it to her, and then told her, That if ≈øhe and others thought that to be the Cau≈øe of the ≈øtorm, ≈øhe and they might do what they would with it; but he profe≈ø≈øed that he ≈øaw no evil in it, neither was his Con≈øcience troubled with it. So ≈øhe took it and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114099:11"/> carried it between Decks to them from whom ≈øhe came, and they agreed to throw it over-board, and it was thrown over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board: but the ≈øtorm did not leave us upon the throwing of this Paper over-board, as it is reported; for they had many great ≈øtorms after that; much le≈ø≈øe was the great and wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance which by Gods mercy he gave unto them from ≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack and drowning at the I≈øles of <hi>Silly,</hi> upon the throwing of that Writing over-board; for that was thrown over long before, at lea≈øt 14 dayes. Al≈øo the error is the more in this, That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is that it was the petition to the <hi>Parliament</hi> that was thrown over-board; and it was only a Copy of a Petition to their own Court at <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi> and the Petition to the Parliament was ≈øtill in the ≈øhip, together with another Copy of that which was thrown over-board, and other Writings of that nature, ≈øome of which are printed in this book, and were as well ≈øaved as their lives and other goods, and are here in <hi>London</hi> to be ≈øeen and made u≈øe of in convenient time.</p>

            <p>Now if any man ask how 'tis evident there is ≈øuch a Plot laid down in that Book? I an≈øwer, (to be very briefe) I ≈øhall give the Reader this light into this de≈øigne. In his Epi≈øtle before the book which he dedicates to the Honourable Commi≈ø≈øioners for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Plantations, he makes five Reque≈øts to them, the fourth of which is, That <hi>they will take into con≈øideration, how de≈øtructive it will be to their Plantations, and proceedings there,</hi> (which ≈øaith he are growing into a Nation) <hi>to an≈øwer to complaints here.</hi> See and ob≈øerve (Reader) how he ≈øeeks to ≈øtop all Appeals from all their unju≈øt Sentences, what≈øoever they may be contrary to the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi> Secondly, he would make their Honours to be the In≈øtruments to ≈øtop the Currant of the greate≈øt Liberty of Engli≈øh ≈øubjects there; he would engage the Parliament in it; and what a de≈øperate bu≈øine≈ø≈øe this would prove, every wi≈øe man may ea≈øily ≈øee: For being begun at this Plantation, by the ≈øame rule others might ≈øeek it ≈øhould extend to all other Plantations, and then why not to <hi>Ireland?</hi> and why ≈øhall not example, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtome, and fair pretences bring it into <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> ≈øo over <hi>England?</hi> And by the way (Reader) mark his great boa≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are <hi>growing into a Nation;</hi> high concel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now (Reader) ob≈øerve their policie, they take the advantage of promoting this de≈øigne, by beginning to write again≈øt <hi>Gorton,</hi> a man whom they know is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious for here≈øie, that ≈øo behind him they may creep and get a ≈øhot at a better game, may beget a good opinion in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Comi≈ø≈øioners by writing again≈øt ≈øuch a evill man; as al≈øo that they may wa≈øh away the opinion that good men heretofore have had of them, that they are Separati≈øts and Schi≈ømaticks, Mr. <hi>Win≈ølow</hi> their Agent in≈øinuates ≈øeverall things of the good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement &amp; communion that the Independents in New-England hold with Presbyterians and the Reformed Churches, of which he had di≈øcour≈øed with ≈øome godly Presbyterians ≈øince his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over into England, and ≈øaith he was earne≈øtly reque≈øted by ≈øome of the Presbyterian party to publi≈øh to the world as much, <hi>pag.</hi> 97. and thereupon tells a long ≈øtory of the Church of <hi>New-Plymouth</hi> belonging to Mr. <hi>Robin≈øon</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> holding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with French and Dutch churches, yea tendring it to the <hi>Scots;</hi> as al≈øo (<hi>pag.</hi> 93.) how the re≈øt of the Churches in New-England do ≈øuffer Presbyterians, and have offered all liberty and priviledges to Presbyterians, <hi>p.</hi> 99. 100. But for an≈øwer, I ≈øay there is a great deal of fallacie in this di≈øcour≈øe, and the contrary is too well known and daily practi≈øed among the Independents both there and here, not admitting the mo≈øt godly men into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among them, not to the acts wherein they hold communion ≈øtands properly; keeping Communion with them in Word and Prayer, which they admit to their <hi>Indians</hi> too. And let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, if they can, among many hundreds, yea ≈øome thou≈øands of Independents that have come from New-England and Holland, that have come to the Lords ≈øupper in our Churches, or done any act among us, in which they hold Church-communion properly ≈øtands? 2. Rather then Mr. <hi>Win≈ølow</hi> will fail of his purpo≈øe, he will make the world believe that the Reformed Churches are as much Separati≈øts as them≈øelves are, by de≈øcribing them with the ≈øame de≈øcription that the Separati≈øts de≈øcribe them≈øelves, <hi>p.</hi> 96. That <hi>they are a People di≈øtinct from the World, and gathered into a holy Communion</hi> (he ≈øhould have ≈øaid Covenant, which is his ≈øen≈øe)
<pb facs="tcp:114099:13"/> 
               <hi>and not National churches,</hi> and that the <hi>≈øixth per≈øon is not of the Church</hi> (meaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them) which fal≈øhood of his he boldly affirms, thinking that many will believe becau≈øe he ≈øaith it, but the contrary is well known to tho≈øe that know them; for in <hi>Holland</hi> they refu≈øe not to baptize any of their Country-mens-children who bring them to be baptized, el≈øe would their unbaptized be ≈øeen among≈øt them as well as they are to be ≈øeen in <hi>New-England;</hi> be≈øides tis well known the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> holds them≈øelves a National church, and hath a National A≈ø≈øembly, and ≈øo the Church of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> hold them≈øelves National churches again≈øt the Independents. 3. As to the great love he in≈øinuates they of <hi>New-England</hi> bear to Presbyterian churches, by the example of Profering certain Scots a <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongst them, where they ≈øhould ≈øhare with them in their lands, and enjoy their liberty of Presbyterial government,</hi> p. 100. I an≈øwer, that pa≈ø≈øage is ≈øtrange, and I can hardly believe it, that they who denied ≈øo many godly Mini≈øters well known to them, Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi> &amp;c. Engli≈øh men, the liberty of enjoying Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall government, ≈øhould grant it to ≈øtrangers of the Scoti≈øh nation. Now that they denied them, is apparent; be≈øides Mr. <hi>Rathband</hi> and other Mini≈øters te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (now with God) and Mr. <hi>A≈øh</hi> of the A≈ø≈øembly and others te≈øtifying ≈øo much, them≈øelves in Print, in the book intituled <hi>Church-government and Church covenant di≈øcu≈ø≈øed,</hi> in an≈ø. to the 31 que≈øt. p. 83, 84. confe≈ø≈øe it, and give rea≈øon of their denial. But if it be true there were any ≈øuch promi≈øe to the <hi>Scots</hi> (which I much que≈øtion) I am confident they had ≈øome de≈øign of their own in it, ≈øome worldly end or other; as namely, That in tho≈øe dangerous times, when it was likely that the time in <hi>England</hi> would ≈øoon be ≈øo bad that they could not be ≈øupplied of nece≈ø≈øaries from <hi>England,</hi> they might then be ≈øupplied from <hi>Scotland</hi> with cloth as leather, &amp; ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>. 4. As for that he ≈øays, that Mr. <hi>Noyce,</hi> Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hubard,</hi> have their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in <hi>New England,</hi> who yet are Presbyterian; I an≈øwer, the Church of the two fir≈øt was founded in the Church way of the <hi>Independent</hi> manner, which is not anew con≈øtituted, though they in their judgments are ≈øomewhat different, and ≈øtill they hold many Independent principles, as may be ≈øeen by Mr. <hi>Noy≈øe's</hi> Book lately printed, though ≈øome Presbyterian principles. 5. For Mr. <hi>Hubard,</hi> dares Mr. <hi>Win≈ølow</hi> ≈øays that Mr. <hi>Hubard</hi> was not puni≈øhed neither directly nor indirectly, for baptizing ≈øome children who≈øe parents were not members of their Churches, and that his ≈øharp fines &amp; di≈øgracefull being bound to the good behaviour, had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the bapti≈øm of tho≈øe children? 6. Can any man think that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpitefull pa≈ø≈øages vented in Pulpits again≈øt the Church of <hi>England</hi> there, by ≈øome of their chief Elders, calling England <hi>Egypt</hi> &amp; <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ≈øaying, that out of their Church-waies we cannot go to Heaven, denying the Scales of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to ≈øome, becau≈øe they would not confe≈ø≈øe that there was no way of God law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to govern the Church by, but the Independent way; and for no other cau≈øe as it is ready to be proved, when ever Mr. <hi>VVin≈ølow</hi> or any other Independents will de≈øired meeting, in <hi>London,</hi> before indifferent Judges; and much more then I will here relate) is a ≈øign of love to the Presbyterian brethren, and of keeping communion with them. 7. Concerning the offer that Mr <hi>VVin≈ølow</hi> ≈øaith was made not long before he came away, by the Court, to certain di≈øcontented per≈øons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding liberty for Presbyterial government, that it was freely is openly tendred to them; this is ≈øtrange news to us here, for we hear not one word of that offer from tho≈øe Petitioners, although here are letters from ≈øome of them dated ≈øince M. <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows</hi> comming from thence, that relates that Dr. <hi>Child</hi> &amp; others of them remained ≈øtill in pri≈øon, ≈øave that D. <hi>Child</hi> hath the liberty to be confined to M. <hi>Laeders</hi> hou≈øe upon ≈øecurity of 800. l. bond being given for his abiding there. For a conclu≈øion of this Po≈øt≈øcript, I ≈øhall de≈øire the Reader by all that hath been ≈øaid, to ob≈øerve how Independents are all of a peece, for ≈øubtilltie, de≈øigns, fallacies, both in <hi>New-England</hi> and in <hi>Old.</hi>
